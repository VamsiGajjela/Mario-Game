# Mario-Game
Mario obstacle avoiding course was created between a fellow classmate and I. Used online resources and classroom resources in order to create this. It utilizes the pygame module in python.
To start this game make sure you open the python file labelled "intro screen"
In order to use this program you must have python 3.6.4
You must also already have the pygame module installed
If you do not, open cmd (command prompt) and copy paste this "py -m pip install -U pygame --user" in order to install pygame
All other required modules should be already be found in python 3.6.4 if any are missing, read online on how to install them
If there is any issues installing pygame or any module check online or contact me at vmgajjela@gmail.com
